# Kalaallisut (Greenlandic) Grammar

Kalaallisut is a highly polysynthetic, agglutinative language with complex word formation and rich morphology.

## Key Features

- **Polysynthetic structure:** Words are built from a root plus many suffixes, often expressing what would be a full sentence in English.
- **Agglutinative morphology:** Suffixes are added sequentially, each with a distinct grammatical function.
- **Ergative-absolutive alignment:** Subjects of intransitive verbs pattern with objects of transitive verbs (absolutive), while subjects of transitive verbs are marked differently (ergative).

## Nouns

- Inflect for **8 grammatical cases**:
  - Absolutive
  - Ergative
  - Instrumental
  - Allative
  - Locative
  - Ablative
  - Prolative
  - Equative
- Mark **possession** with suffixes.

## Pronouns

- Personal pronouns are often incorporated as suffixes.
- There is a **fourth person (obviative)** to distinguish multiple third-person participants.
- Pronouns attach to verbs and nouns to indicate person and number.

## Verbs

- Inflect for **subject and object agreement**.
- Have **8 moods**, including indicative, interrogative, imperative, conditional, participial, and more.
- **No grammatical tense**; time is expressed through context or adverbials.
- Use **derivational suffixes** extensively to modify meaning.
- Employ **switch-reference markers** to indicate whether subjects of linked clauses are the same or different.

## Suffixes (Uiguutit)

- Hundreds of suffixes exist, divided into **derivational** and **inflectional**.
- **Derivational suffixes** create new words or modify meaning (e.g., causative, reflexive, reciprocal, diminutive).
- **Inflectional suffixes** mark grammatical categories like case, mood, person, number.
- Suffixes can be stacked in long chains, following specific ordering rules.

## Examples of suffixes

- **-liar**: indicates 'to do repeatedly' or 'habitually'.
- **-gu / -gut**: case endings (e.g., allative, prolative).
- **-niar**: future or intention.
- **-voq / -put**: verb endings indicating person and number.
- **-siut**: instrument noun suffix.

## Summary

Kalaallisut grammar is characterized by its complex suffix system, polysynthetic word structure, ergative alignment, and rich derivational morphology. Words can encode extensive grammatical and semantic information, making the language both expressive and structurally intricate.
